# Introduction

This book is about rust primitives that are built to enable safely doing things
that otherwise require `unsafe` code. Thus, this book is focused on the `Rc` `RefCell` and `Once_cell`s of rust, and not on the other myriad rust patterns and primitives.

Currently, This book is in a very very empty state. It's not even served as a webpage yet. And if it doesn't get enough attention, it might forever stay a work in progress.

If you would like to prevent that, contributions are always welcome!
